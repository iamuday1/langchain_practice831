# bank_chat spec

 

## Purpose

A chat program where a customer asks a bank assistant questions

and sees what each answer cost us.

 

## User

A bank customer typing in a terminal window.

 

## It must

- Show the assistant's answer to each question.

- Keep chatting until the user types "quit".

- Remember what the user said earlier in the same chat.

- Show each answer's cost in ₹ and the total so far.

 

## It must not

- Keep the secret key inside the code.

- Answer questions unrelated to banking.

 

## Done when

1. I ask "What is a fixed deposit?" → a short, sensible answer.

2. I type "My name is Ravi", then "What's my name?" → it answers "Ravi".

3. I ask three questions → the ₹ total goes up after every answer.

4. I type "quit" → the program ends.
